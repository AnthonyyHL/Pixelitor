# Contributing to Pixelitor

Thank you for considering contributing to Pixelitor!

Before you start contributing, please make sure to read and understand the guidelines below.

If you have a new feature, bugfix, or performance optimization in mind, please start by opening an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lbalazscs/Pixelitor/issues) and discussing your idea. 
This will help to ensure that your contribution aligns with the project goals, avoids duplicated work, and maintains the code quality. 
If you have any questions about the project or how to contribute, feel free to ask in the issue tracker. 
Alternatively, you can also send an email or discuss your idea on [Discord](https://discord.gg/SXaxYnBSTv).

## Code formatting

If you're contributing code, I don't really mind how you format the new code, but please don't change the formatting of the existing code, because this would make it more difficult to see the differences.
If you have a habit of automatically formatting code while you write, you can find the Java formatting rules I use in the "stuff/intellij_formatting_config.xml" file.
You can import this file into IntelliJ Idea to make sure you're using the same formatting rules.
